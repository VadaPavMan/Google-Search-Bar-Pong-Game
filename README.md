# Features:
- Dynamic Gameplay: The ball starts with a slow horizontal movement to allow the player to hit it, then gains speed after the first hit.
- Themed Visuals: Backgrounds, paddles, and the ball are all customized with Google-inspired textures, enhancing the gameplay experience.
- Automatic Opponent (CPU): A built-in AI controls one of the paddles, challenging you to test your skills.
- Scorekeeping: Keep track of both players' scores on the in-game scoreboard.
- Game Over Screen: Displays a win message for the player reaching the winning score limit.
- Toggle Backgrounds: Background images change every few seconds, adding visual interest.
- Future Additions:
I plan to implement new features, such as sound effects and background music, power-ups, and additional difficulty levels.

#Controls:
**Player 1** (Left Paddle):
- W - Move Up
- S - Move Down

**Player 2** (Right Paddle - CPU-controlled): 
- Reacts to the ball’s position automatically.

# Tech Stack:
Built using Raylib with C++, making use of textures, vector math, and collision handling.
